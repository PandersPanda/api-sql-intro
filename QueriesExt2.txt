Create a new directors table. Each director should have a name and a unique director id. Recreate your films table and add a directorId column. Insert a few director records (the data does not need to be real, you can just make directors up). Re-insert your film data, updating each film ao it will have a directorId. Using an SQL JOIN, write a SELECT statement that returns a list of films with their director.


CREATE TABLE directors(
	directorId SERIAL,
	name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (directorId)
);

INSERT INTO directors (name)
VALUES('Anders'), ('Per'), ('Line'), ('Loke'), ('Gunnar'), ('Petter'), ('Ole'), ('Tina'), ('Jonas'), ('Trine');

ALTER TABLE films
ADD directorsId int;

Added id-es with UPDATE

ALTER TABLE films
ADD FOREIGN KEY(directorsid) REFERENCES directors(directorid);

SELECT * FROM films
INNER JOIN directors 
ON directors.directorid=films.directorsid;
